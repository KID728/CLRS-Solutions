## 1.2-1

like amap app, computes the optimal route between start point and end point, weighing costs and road conditions in different transport.

involved algorithms include sort, shortest-path. 

## 1.2-2

this problem is equivalent to solve non-equality :
$$
8n^2 < 64n \lg n
$$

$$
n <8 \lg n
$$

n is an integer, so if the value of n is 1 insertion sort will beat merge sort.

## 1.2-3

this problem is equivalent to solve non-equality :
$$
100n^2 < 2^n
$$
n is an integer, so when the value of n is greater than or equal 15, an algorithm whose running time is 100n^2 runs faster than an algorithm whose running time is 2^n on the same machine .
