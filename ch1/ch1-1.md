shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems both require find a solution or algorithm to computer a most optimal path in some given vertices and distances between vertices. they both consider the connections of vertices and costs. they will traverse all vertices in solving process.

in shortest-path problem, the start vertex and the end vertex is different, and the shortest-path doesn't need go through all vertices.

in traveling-salesman problem, the start vertex and the end vertex is same, and the most optimal path need include all vertices.
